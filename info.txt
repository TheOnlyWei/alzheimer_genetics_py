RAW FILE INFO AND CHOICE OF DATABASES

ROSMAP_RNASeq_entrez.csv:  (567 rows, 16,382 columns) Comma separated
  - Stored in PostgreSQL
  - 16,380 columns of Gene IDs
  - Generally well-structured data with only 3 NULL values.
  - gene expression values are stored in PostgreSQL arrays
  - A gene_id_to_index table was created to map from gene_id to its
    corresponding index in rosmap_rnaseq_entrez table.
    - Takes only 102 milliseconds to retrieve gene_id's of 567 rows
  - Aggregation functions such as min(), max(), and std() are typically faster
    in a SQL database than a column-family, document-store, or a key-value store
    database.
    - And since database is not static, the mininum, maximum, and standard
      deviation will change and needs to be recalculated.
  - The only issue is horizontal scalability. We don't expect the database to
    grow in columns, but we expect rows to grow. PostgreSQL is row-oriented, so
    it fits our needs here as well.
  - We also don't expect rows to grow fast, unlike social media data.
  - Related to "patients.csv"

patients.csv (567 rows, 4 columns) Comma separated
  - Stored in PostgreSQL
  - Generally well structured, not a lot of missing data.
  - Only rows are expected to grow, although not horizontally scalable, a
    row-oriented database such as PostgreSQL fits the job.
  - Related to "ROSMAP_RNASeq_entrez.csv"

entrez_ids_uniprot.csv:  (117,493 rows, 3 columns) Tab separated
  - Stored in PostgreSQL
  - Entrez ID to Uniprot ID is one to many mapping

BIOGRID-MV-Physical-3.4.144:  (196,060, 24) Tab separated
  - Stored in Neo4j.
  - Associated data fits the criteria for a graph database such as Neo4j.
  - Only two columns, Entrez Gene Interactor A and Entrez Gene Interactor B
    are stored.
  - Entrez Gene Interactor are IDs related to gene ids in
    "ROSMAP_RNASeq_entrez.csv" and Entrez IDs in "entrez_ids_uniprot.csv"

unitprot-human.xml
  - Stored in MongoDB
  - XML are documents best stored in a document database such as MongoDB.
  - The file is extremely large and may grow. MongoDB is NoSQL, and is scalable
    across multiple servers by sharding data.
